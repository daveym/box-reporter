**Hi there!**

If your are seeing this, you have hopefully permitted Lint to access your Pocket data. Lint aims to help you visualise what you've saved off to Pocket through the command line, with a view that you can use it's output to bulk update items, or as input to your other programs.

With Lint, you'll be able to retrieve items, retag them, delete them, archive them and more. Lint is powered by the Pocket API, and is open sourced under the MIT License, so if you fancy adding some new features, come ahead and get involved.

Thanks for giving lint a try.
